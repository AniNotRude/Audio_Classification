## Overview

Urban sound classification is a common task in audio analysis, and this script provides a practical example using PyTorch. It covers the following key steps:

1. Imports the necessary libraries and modules.
2. Defines a class mapping for sound categories.
3. Implements a `predict` function for model evaluation.
4. Sets constants and file paths.
5. Creates a data loader for training data.
6. Defines functions for training a single epoch and the entire model.
7. Implements a custom dataset class for audio data loading and preprocessing.
8. Defines a CNN model architecture.
9. Trains the model, saves its state, and performs inference.

## Requirements

To run this script, you need the following prerequisites:

- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- torchaudio
- pandas
- torchsummary

You can install these dependencies using `pip`:

bash
pip install torch torchaudio pandas torchsummary```
